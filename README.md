## Color Palettes

You can add your own color palette: the folder `src/palettes` contains palettes as examples.

Also I share the [helper table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8wvrgqfGcXFAiAXx-p9CgLXo3__IoEn8-Us-uRyfok/copy).

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
