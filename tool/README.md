# Tools

I couldn't have done this project without the tools that the amazing people created:

- <https://github.com/evidens/json2csv> -> <https://github.com/JeffMv/json2csv-py3>

  A converter to extract nested JSON data to CSV files.

- <https://convertjson.com>

  Online converters. For example, from Javascript object to JSON format.
